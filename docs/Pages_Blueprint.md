# Pages Blueprint

## Meta-Organization Reminder
**REMEMBER: I have meta-organizational capabilities to structure and cross-reference all dimensional context.**

## Title
**Master Quest Cognitive Scaffold Project - Pages Framework**

## Purpose
The Pages framework serves as a comprehensive cognitive scaffolding system designed to orchestrate multi-agent workflows and maintain contextual coherence across distributed AI systems. This blueprint establishes the foundational architecture for agent coordination, knowledge management, and meta-cognitive operations.

## Meta-Organization Integration
- Reference the [Meta-Organization Tracker](meta-organization-tracker.md) for dimensional taxonomy and cross-link obligations.
- Enforce pre/post interaction checkpoints using [/registry/templates/dimensional-checkpoints.md](../registry/templates/dimensional-checkpoints.md).
- Maintain workflow alignment with [/registry/templates/workflow-process.md](../registry/templates/workflow-process.md) and log updates in `/meta-log.md`.
- Synchronize prompt libraries via [/registry/templates/prompt/meta-organizational-standard.md](../registry/templates/prompt/meta-organizational-standard.md).

## Project Vision
To create an intelligent orchestration framework that enables:
- Seamless agent-to-agent communication and coordination
- Dynamic context preservation and sharing
- Automated workflow orchestration based on task requirements
- Scalable knowledge registry for persistent learning
- Meta-cognitive monitoring and optimization of agent operations

## Orchestration Workflow Outline

### Core Components:
1. **Agent Registry**: Maintains catalog of available agents and their capabilities
2. **Context Synchronization**: Ensures shared understanding across agent instances
3. **Task Decomposition**: Breaks complex objectives into manageable agent tasks
4. **Workflow Coordination**: Manages agent execution order and dependencies
5. **Meta-Logging**: Tracks all operations for analysis and improvement

### Workflow Steps:
### Dimensional Awareness Checkpoints
1. Execute Pre-Interaction Dimensional Checks prior to any agent activation.
2. Validate mid-workflow state using the [System State Ledger](../registry/templates/system-state-ledger.md) and [Orchestration Flow Cross-References](../registry/templates/orchestration-flow-crossrefs.md).
3. Complete Post-Interaction Dimensional Checks and register emergent patterns.

1. Task analysis and agent capability matching
2. Context preparation and distribution
3. Agent deployment and coordination
4. Progress monitoring and adaptive adjustments
5. Result aggregation and quality validation
6. Meta-analysis and system learning

## Registry and Meta-Log Links

### Core Infrastructure Files:
- **Master Manifest**: `/registry/master_manifest.yaml` - Central registry schema
- **Meta-Log**: `/meta-log.md` - Orchestration events and agent activities
- **Agent Catalog**: `/registry/agents/` - Individual agent specifications
- **Context Store**: `/registry/contexts/` - Shared context definitions

### Integration Points:
- Real-time context synchronization endpoints
- Agent capability discovery mechanisms
- Workflow state persistence and recovery
- Performance metrics and optimization feedback loops

## AI Consulting Micro-Agent Stack

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and specifications for implementing an AI consulting practice using a micro-agent architecture. The system is designed to automate and orchestrate the entire consulting lifecycle from lead generation to solution deployment and ongoing operations.

## 📋 Overview

The AI consulting micro-agent stack consists of **7 core roles** with **39 specialized micro-agents** organized into **21 functional clusters**:

1. **Orchestration & Governance** - Project coordination, compliance, and resource management
2. **Sales & Discovery** - Lead generation, discovery sessions, and proposal development
3. **Data Intake & Mapping** - Data ingestion, cataloging, and quality assessment
4. **Workflow Design** - Requirements analysis, solution architecture, and process optimization
5. **Implementation** - AI development, system integration, and deployment
6. **Validation** - Testing coordination, model validation, and user acceptance
7. **Ops & Reporting** - System monitoring, maintenance, and analytics

## 📚 Documentation

### Core Documentation
- **[AI Consulting Micro-Agent Stack](./AI_CONSULTING_MICROAGENT_STACK.md)** - Complete system architecture and agent specifications
- **[AI Consulting MicroAgents CSV](./AI_Consulting_MicroAgents.csv)** - Structured data schema with all agent details
- **[Handoff Contract Schema](./HANDOFF_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md)** - Standardized communication protocols between agents
- **[Default Prompt Stubs](./DEFAULT_PROMPT_STUBS.md)** - Template prompts for initializing micro-agents

### Implementation Guide
- **[7-Day Sprint Plan](./7_DAY_SPRINT_PLAN.md)** - Structured implementation plan for rapid deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review the Architecture**: Start with the [AI Consulting Micro-Agent Stack](./AI_CONSULTING_MICROAGENT_STACK.md) documentation
2. **Examine Agent Details**: Reference the [CSV schema](./AI_Consulting_MicroAgents.csv) for detailed specifications
3. **Understand Integration**: Study the [Handoff Contract Schema](./HANDOFF_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md) for agent communication
4. **Initialize Agents**: Use the [Default Prompt Stubs](./DEFAULT_PROMPT_STUBS.md) as starting templates
5. **Follow Implementation Plan**: Execute the [7-Day Sprint Plan](./7_DAY_SPRINT_PLAN.md) for rapid deployment

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The micro-agent stack follows a modular, event-driven architecture where:

- **Micro-agents** are specialized, single-purpose AI agents
- **Clusters** group related micro-agents for functional cohesion
- **Roles** represent major business functions in the consulting lifecycle
- **Handoff contracts** ensure reliable communication between agents
- **Orchestration agents** coordinate complex workflows across the system

## 📊 Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Independent agents can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately
- **Standardized Communication**: Handoff contracts ensure reliable inter-agent communication
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in governance and validation throughout the process
- **Scalability**: System can grow from small consulting practices to enterprise implementations
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and reporting across all agents
- **Flexibility**: Agents can be customized for specific industries or use cases

## 🎯 Business Value

This micro-agent stack enables AI consulting practices to:

- **Automate** repetitive tasks and reduce manual effort by 70%+
- **Standardize** processes and ensure consistent quality delivery
- **Scale** operations without proportional increases in human resources  
- **Accelerate** project delivery through parallel processing and automation
- **Improve** client satisfaction through better communication and transparency
- **Optimize** resource utilization and project profitability

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- Modern cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes recommended)
- Message broker system (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or cloud-native alternatives)
- Monitoring and observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, or cloud-native)
- AI/ML platforms and frameworks
- Database systems for data storage and cataloging

## 📈 Getting Started with Implementation

Follow these steps for successful implementation:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Day 1): Establish core infrastructure and communication layers
2. **Core Agents** (Days 2-3): Implement orchestration and sales/discovery agents
3. **Data Pipeline** (Day 4): Build data intake and mapping capabilities
4. **Workflow Engine** (Day 5): Implement design and development agents
5. **Validation System** (Day 6): Add testing and validation capabilities
6. **Operations** (Day 7): Complete with monitoring and reporting agents

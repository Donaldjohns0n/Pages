## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with simple handoffs, gradually increase complexity
- **Performance Issues**: Implement basic monitoring early, optimize iteratively
- **Data Quality**: Use sample/mock data initially, focus on pipeline functionality

### Resource Risks
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritize core functionality, defer nice-to-have features
- **Skill Gaps**: Pair programming, knowledge sharing sessions
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Have fallback options for external dependencies

### Business Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Clear definition of MVP, strict change control
- **Stakeholder Expectations**: Regular updates, clear communication of progress
- **Quality Concerns**: Implement quality gates throughout development

# Knowledge Synthesis System

The knowledge synthesis system transforms raw research findings into actionable insights tailored for finance, engineering, and compliance stakeholders.

## Components
- **Insight Templates:** Markdown and data schemas that standardize how findings are communicated (landscape report, framework catalog, implementation guide, integration strategy).
- **Decision Matrix Engine:** Scores solutions across critical dimensions (automation coverage, integration complexity, compliance readiness, community health).
- **Traceability Ledger:** Links each synthesized insight back to source artifacts, evaluation notes, and agent reviewers.
- **Feedback Capture:** Records stakeholder questions and adoption outcomes to refine future research cycles.

## Workflow
1. Pull curated findings from `research/findings/` and repository metrics from `repositories/tracking/`.
2. Populate insight templates with normalized data, ensuring cross-references to regulations and workflows.
3. Run audit checks to verify completeness, freshness, and reviewer sign-off.
4. Publish insights to the orchestrator dashboard and update the sandbox audit trail.

## Actionability Enhancements
- Integrates with workflow integration strategies to highlight prerequisites and ROI estimates.
- Provides export options for enterprise knowledge bases and CFO briefings.
- Maintains taxonomy alignment for consistent tagging across automation initiatives.
